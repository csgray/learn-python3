# Learn Python 3

This repository is the result of my working through [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/).

As such, there's not much new in here. It's a collection of exercises designed for beginners, but since I have C++ experience and am learning Python for work, I am working through it more quickly than I would like. That said: I've found the book to be well worth the $30, especially for new programmers, and I recommend you check it out for yourself.

## Points of Interest for Other Newbies

* [ex22.md](https://github.com/csgray/learn-python3/blob/master/ex22.md) is a collection of Python words and symbols that I've picked up throughout the book.
* [ex27.md](https://github.com/csgray/learn-python3/blob/master/ex27.md) is a set of Boolean truth tables. Learn them and love them. 
* [ex37.md](https://github.com/csgray/learn-python3/blob/master/ex37.md) is a collection of keywords, data types, string escape sequences, old style string formats, and operators.

## Stuff To Make Better:

### Exercise 36: Designing and Debugging

This is supposed to be a little text-based adventure game using lists, functions, and modules. No longer a lame little shell, my game is slowly coming together. It needs more work until is worthy of its title!

### Exercise 43: Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

This is just the shell code. It is another text-based adventure game, but it uses objects like I originally wanted to do. I'm not a fan of the whole 'Gothon' thing, so I want to redo this game as an updated version of exercise 36.
